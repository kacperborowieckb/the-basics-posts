# React Hook Form (basics)

We will take a look at just a basics of React Hook Form. We won't focus on more advanced use cases such as working with external UI liblaries and using "Controller" from RHF. So let's started.

In this article we'll build a basic form using React Hook Form with zod validation. At the end you will be able to build something like this:

Form should be here:

<form action="" className="flex flex-col gap-2">
  <input type="text" className="bg-amber-400 p-8 text-red-600" />
  <input type="text" />
  <input type="text" />
  <input type="text" />
</form>

<p className="text-red-600">Styled with tailwind</p>

React Hook Form provides one main hook you will use every time called **useForm**
